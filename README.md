# About 

I worked on creating a static landing page using only HTML/CSS. My mockup, my HTML-only page, and my final web and mobile pages are below.

# What worked


# What didn't work

There were issues making a mobile version. My navigation bar had gray links, and I wanted white links for my checkbox hack menu on the mobile version. Although my white nav link CSS code was in the "mobile only" section, my regular screen had white links as well. This wasn't an issue for some other components, only the nav bar links. I realized that even though I stated nav links, footer links, and span links separately, they were all the color of the footer links and the footer link CSS was overwriting everything else.
