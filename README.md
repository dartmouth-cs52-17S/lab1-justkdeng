# About 

I worked on creating a static landing page using only HTML/CSS.

### Mockup:

### HTML only:

# What worked

I was able to get my Sign In formatted separately from my nav bar by putting it in a `<span>` within the `<nav>` section. This was nice since it was the only `<span>` in my HTML, so I didn't need a class or ID, or nest two groups within `<nav>`. I got a mobile menu popup using the CSS checkbox hack and used the same `<nav>` 

I had from the regular site, just with a flex column instead of a row. I was also able to do rounded rectangles, text inside my input box, and drop shadows like in my mockup. Also my mobile menu is hamburger style.

# What didn't work

I had a lot of trouble with flexbox at first because spacing wasn't as easy as expected. It was difficult to use flex to get space-between, while also centering the group. I ended up using padding for this. Also my mobile version wouldn't show up on my cell phone and instead went to my regular site, until I changed the HTML.
